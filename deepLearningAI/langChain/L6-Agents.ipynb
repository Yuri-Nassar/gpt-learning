      "Summary: Machine learning (ML) is a field devoted to understanding and building methods that let machines \"learn\" â€“ that is, methods that leverage data to improve computer performance on some set of tasks.Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, agriculture, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.Some implementations of machine learning use data and artificial neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain.In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.\n",

      "Page: Quantum machine learning\n",
      "Summary: Quantum machine learning is the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning programs. The most common use of the term refers to machine learning algorithms for the analysis of classical data executed on a quantum computer, i.e. quantum-enhanced machine learning. While machine learning algorithms are used to compute immense quantities of data, quantum machine learning utilizes qubits and quantum operations or specialized quantum systems to improve computational speed and data storage done by algorithms in a program. This includes hybrid methods that involve both classical and quantum processing, where computationally difficult subroutines are outsourced to a quantum device. These routines can be more complex in nature and executed faster on a quantum computer. Furthermore, quantum algorithms can be used to analyze quantum states instead of classical data. Beyond quantum computing, the term \"quantum machine learning\" is also associated with classical machine learning methods applied to data generated from quantum experiments (i.e. machine learning of quantum systems), such as learning the phase transitions of a quantum system or creating new quantum experiments. Quantum machine learning also extends to a branch of research that explores methodological and structural similarities between certain physical systems and learning systems, in particular neural networks. For example, some mathematical and numerical techniques from quantum physics are applicable to classical deep learning and vice versa. Furthermore, researchers investigate more abstract notions of learning theory with respect to quantum information, sometimes referred to as \"quantum learning theory\".\n",

Useful for when you need to answer general questions about people, places, companies, facts, historical events, or other subjects. Input should be a search query.\\ntime: time(text: str) -> str - Returns todays date, use this for any     questions related to knowing todays date.     The input should always be an empty string,     and this function will always return todays     date - any date mathmatics should occur     outside this function.\\n\\nThe way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.\\nSpecifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).\\n\\nThe only values that should be in the \\\"action\\\" field are: Calculator, Wikipedia, time\\n\\nThe $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"action\\\": $TOOL_NAME,\\n  \\\"action_input\\\": $INPUT\\n}\\n```\\n\\nALWAYS use the following format:\\n\\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\\nThought: you should always think about what to do\\nAction:\\n```\\n$JSON_BLOB\\n```\\nObservation: the result of the action\\n... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)\\nThought: I now know the final answer\\nFinal Answer: the final answer to the original input question\\n\\nBegin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.\\nHuman: whats the date today?\\n\\nThis was your previous work (but I haven't seen any of it! I only see what you return as final answer):\\nThought: I need to use the `time` tool to get today's date.\\nAction:\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"action\\\": \\\"time\\\",\\n  \\\"action_input\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nObservation: 2023-06-26\\nThought:\"\n",
